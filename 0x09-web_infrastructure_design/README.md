# 0x09. Web infrastructure design
Over the course of a week, I engaged in a project focused on researching and conceptualizing web infrastructure design. During this period, I explored various design principles and created diagrams on a whiteboard to illustrate the evolution of a web infrastructure. Commencing with a basic LAMP model, the design progressed into a comprehensive system characterized by distribution, monitoring, and security measures.

The project files include references to each corresponding whiteboard diagram.
